## Privacy Policy
This app collects information about your location while active and in the background.

The naturalistic driving app collects GPS and accelerometry data as you drive your own vehicle. When you tap the "Logging" button, your GPS and accelerometry data will be recorded by the app, saved to your phone, before being securely uploaded to a Google Firebase server. You will be able to turn off the logger by touching the "Stop Logging" button or the logger will automatically turn off after 1 hour. Attached to the data will be a unique ID code that is a series of random numbers and letters, this is so we can track individuals across our studies.

No other data will be collected from your device.

Upon completion of the research, the collected information concerning your responses will be de-identified, securely stored, on a secure UWA OneDrive cloud server, and kept strictly confidential. Research records will be retained for a minimum of 7 years after date of publication or project completion on the Western Australian Centre for Road Safety Researchâ€™s UWA secure network drive, whichever is later. They will not be released unless the investigator is required to do so by law. These data will be used to produce research reports, in the form of theses and/or scientific papers. No names or identifying information will be used in any report written about the study.
